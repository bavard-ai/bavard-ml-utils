    When inherited from and implemented, the subclass will inherit
    behavior for turning automatically into a web service.

    All sublcass methods that are decorated with `@endpoint` will be exposed as
    endpoints in a web service, and should be declared the way a FastAPI app method
    would be declared. This includes the requirement that the return value of each method be JSON
    serializeable. All parameters passed to the `@endpoint` decorator will be
    forwarded on to `fastapi.FastAPI.add_api_route`.

    As an example:

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class AddInput(BaseModel):
        num: int

    class MyWebService(WebService):

        @endpoint
        def hello(self):
            return {"message": "Hello world!"}

        @endpoint(methods=["POST"], path="/do-add")
        def add(self, inputs: AddInput):
            return inputs.num + 1

        def other(self):
            return "This method will not be a HTTP endpoint"

    service = MyWebService()
    app = service.to_app()
    ```

    `app` is a FastApi web service with two endpoints: `/hello` supporting GET
    requests, and `/do-add` supporting POST requests with a request body that must
    look like: `{ "num": <int> }`.
